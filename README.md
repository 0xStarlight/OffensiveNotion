# OffensiveNotion
Notion as a platform for offensive operations

## Wait, what?
Yes.

## But Why?
What started as a meme grew into a full project. Just roll with it.

### Setup
To use Notion as a platform for offensive operations, you need a few things:

- A Notion account, available [here](https://www.notion.so/signup)
- A Notion Developers API account, available [here](https://developers.notion.com/)

### Setting Up A Listener Page
The "listener" is just a page in a Notion notebook. But you can set it up to catch the callbacks for your agents:

1) Create your listener page. Simply add a new page to Notion, preferably in a notebook that's not being used for anything else:

2) In the upper right corner, click "Share" and "Invite". Add your Notion Developer API account to this page:

3) Copy the URL of your page down. If you're in the web browser Notion client, this can be taken from the URL of the page. In the desktop app, enter `ctl-l` to copy it to your clipboard.
4) If your listener URL is:
```
https://www.notion.so/LISTENER-11223344556677889900112233445566                     
```
... then your **parent page ID** is the number after the name of the listener, split with hyphens into the following schema: 8-4-4-4-12.
Meaning, your parent page ID would be: `11223344-5566-7788-9900-112233445566`. This value is used to connect your agent to your listener, so keep track of it!

5) Build your agent. From the root directory, enter:
```
$ cargo build [--release]
```

## Agent Control
When your agent is built and dispatched to the target environment, it uses your secret key and the parent page ID to check in. Once this happens, a new page with the hostname of where the agent landed will appear as a child page of your listener:

When you click on this page, you are now in the agent's "session". Which is really just a notebook page for the most part, but has some special functions.

### Running commands
Make a `To Do` block and add any shell command you want to run on the target. When you are ready to execute the command, add the bullseye emoji to the end: ðŸŽ¯

When your agent checks in, the stdout of the command will be added to the notebook under the `To Do` block as code-syntax highlighted text.

Hey, remember this is a normal Notion page! Add some documentation for your operation while you go:

Why not stack up a bunch of commands to do initial check-in safety checks...

... and then run them all when an agent checks in?
