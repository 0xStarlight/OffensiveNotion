### Wait, What?
Yes.

### But Why?
What started as a meme grew into a full project. Just roll with it.

## Features
* üì° A full-featured C2 platform built on the Notion notetaking app.
* üöß Easy setup: set up your Notion developer API account, drop the Agent to the target, run and enjoy!
* üñ•Ô∏è Cross-platform agent built in Rust that compiles for Linux and Windows with the same code base.
* ‚ò¢Ô∏è A range of capabilities including port-scanning, privilege escalation, asynchronous command execution, file download, and shellcode injection, all controlled from the comfort of a Notion page!
* üìú Document as you go! The agent identifies special syntax to run commands, so feel free to use the rest of the Notion page to document your operation.
* üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Stealth! C2 comms ride over the Notion API natively. Your C2 traffic looks like someone is using Notion for its intended purpose.

## Quickstart
See the [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/HuskyHacks/OffensiveNotion/wiki/2.-Quickstart) on how to get going right away!

## Thanks & Acknowledgements
> This project has been a blast for me! I learned a ton about Rust and how the mechanics of a C2 work. So thank you to my co-creator @mttaggart for helping me along the way. None of this would have been possible without your technical acumen and creativity.
>
>Thank you to Joe Helle (@joehelle) for the POC steps for the fodhelper UAC bypass.
>
>Thank you to all of the great red team devs who came before me, too numerous to list them all, who have created some of my favorite tools. I‚Äôm continually inspired by the red dev innovation in our field.
